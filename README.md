# Curiosity-Cabinet
A curated mix of unique and unusual websites showcasing my diverse collection of interests and experiences. Explore this hub to find new hobbies, projects, and insights!

## Intro
This webpage is a collection of interests I've had, currently have, and want to try in the future, in addition to a variety of webpages I think are cool&mdash;by content, design, and functionality. This personal webpage was originally an assignment in my Web Programming course at UC Davis Spring 2024; however, I've decided to continue keep it up to date.

## Design Choices
I modeled my color scheme based on my high school graduation photo and used Coolors.come to help select the perfect palette. My favorite colors are Navy Blue and Maroon Red, and my HS colors were blue and white. The fact that the orange and pistachio green matched my photo was a coincidence until about halfway through the design of my main page. 

One feature I love about most websites is that the top left corner typically has a logo that when clicked brings the user back to the home page. I incorporated several local links in my page in the banner at the top of the screen and one "back to top" button as the bottom. I also had a lot of fun using different hover effects.

## Responsive Design Techniques
To make my page responsive, I implemented a handful of flex boxes and changed the flex direction when the screen dimensions changed to a certain degree. This involved altering the width of some images. 

## Accessibility Considerations
I added alt and title tags to all my images, though the alt and title words are essentially the same. I also included title text for the links as well. I believe that it may be nice to have additional information about where a link will take you before you click on it. 

## Personal Significance and Challenges
I have lists of useful webpages and books I wanted to read on my computer and a drawer of random interets--juggling balls, origami paper, arduinos, etc. It was fun to consolidate them all into one place and make it look nice. I had a lot of fun with thi project. As I created it, I remembered interests I had long forgotten I knew how to do&mdash;pen spinning, and sabring champange bottles. The page grew bigger than I anticipated, and there's still a lot I want to add. In the future, I would love to create other pages to better organize all the content.

I understand having more pages in a website can make it more complicated and difficult for a user to explore, so my next challenge will be to strike a balance between organized and convoluted.

The biggest challenge I had was with CSS and making all the margins and padding do what I wanted, especially after making the webpage responsive. Additionaly, while I have some CSS experience from high school, I had to relearn the different class combinators&mdash;the difference between a space, comma, arrow, etc&mdash;and completely forgot that code further down the file had higher priority. I moved some stuff around for better readability and some styles were thrown out of whack.
