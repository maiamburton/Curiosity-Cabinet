                <p>Hi! My name is Maia Burton. I'm a computer science graduate from UC Davis with a range of interests. Beyond my major, 
                    I like folding origami, reading murder mysteries, and learning new skills.  <br>
                    <br>
                    I'm a bit of a hoarder/pack rat when it comes to hobbies and unique, unusual websites. This site is my 
                    personal collection of interests and experiences&mdash;a mix of what I know and what I'm curious about.
                    Maybe you'll discover a new interest too.</p>

                        <p>My interest in origami started in elementary school where I'd originally taken an interest 
                            in it solely because it was a skill I knew my friends didn't have, and I thought it was cool. 
                            (Turns out it was! I traded a lot of origami dragons and jumping frogs for fruit roll ups during lunch time)
                        </p>
                        <p>As I grew older, I realized origami has deep mathematics, physics, and engineering roots (far out 
                            of my scope of understanding), which only gave me a deeper love and appreciation for the art.
                             Here are some Youtube videos about the science of paper folding and my favorite origami design:

                        <p>Puzzles, specifically Rubik's cubes and their variations, were a big passion of mine during COVID. I am not a speed 
                            cuber by any means; much like my origami origin story, I love to collect knowledge and skills more than I feel the 
                            need to master them. My collection of Rubik's puzzles is evidence of that. All the listed hobbies in this section

                                Balisong (Butterfly) knife tricks are a display of dexterity, focus, and coordination. While it is a weapon, it has been adopted 
                                into a fidget/skill toy. I developed in interest during my second year of college (2021) while COVID limitations were still in effect. 
                                These were a lot of fun to play with and would be very impressive to master.

                                        or just learned yo-yo tricks&mdash;could've, should've, would've.</li>
                                    <li>Pen spinning is also a thing! I learned to do a <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/Adnhq2KLDwA?feature=shared">basic twirl</a> in high school 
                                        (but subsequent attempts at other tricks have only resulted in lauched pens across the room) WIRED magazine also has a

                                    I learned how to perform the classic cascade pattern when I was a sophmore/junior of high school. My senior year, my goal was to sing

                                    (This link is worth watching) I only got to letter 'M' before I quit&mdash;juggling reliably for over two minutes and memorizing lyrics was quite a challenge.

                                    One thing I love more than impressing my friends with party tricks, like juggling, is playing games that are rigged for me to win. When I was in high school, I had a lot of fun learning 
                                    card tricks and playing bar games. (Yes, I'm not a very good friend) These are some of my favorite.
                                    <ul>

                                        <ul>
                                            I've played this game maybe 30 times in my life, and I've only lost once. It's such a cool one to play with friends.
                                        </ul>

                                        This is my favorite game to play because it seems like a fair game and one of strong math skills. It only requires a little memorization. (There is 
                                        a regular nim, but it's less impressive when you win and more obvious to anyone who has done any discrete math puzzles&mdash;any CS major)

                                        I don't know where the idea of building a house of cards using triangles came from, but it's wrong. I'm no advanced card stacker, but I have built several 
                                        three story buildings that supported a full hydroflask, a graphing calculator, and an orange at the same time. (Unfortunately, I could not find photo evidence) 
                                        Try it! It's a lot of fun.

                                        This was a short lived fascination. In elementary school, I thought Harry Houdini was pretty cool. I learned how handcuff locks worked and learned how to use a handcuff shim, 
                                        padlock shim, and how the average lock worked&mdash;and how to pick those as well.
                                        <p class="footnote">NOTE: Picking locks that you do not own or you do not have consent to manipulate is a crime.</p>

                                        I've done this with a full bottle and mini apple cider ones from the dollar store. It's SO much fun, and the popping sound is so satisfying.

                            <p class="books">The Broken Window is the 9th book in the <strong>Lincoln Rhyme series</strong>, but was the one I started with, not realizing it was a series at the 
                                time. Not only does Jeffery Deaver write incredible plot twists and a fast-pasted narrative, this novel in particular explores the terrifying side of technology 
                                and data collecting. The criminal in this book steals identities, profiles their victims, and falsifies government documents to misdirect authorities and frame 
                                others for murders they committed. 
                            </p>
                            <p>I've read five of the sixteen books in this series so far, and each one has had an incredible reveal and a well-researched, unique theme throughout. I also love the 
                                fact that I can speculate as much as I want, who the killer is, and still never see the plot twists coming... whether that reveals more about my detective skills 
                                or Deaver's writing ones is up for debate. You can decide.

                                <li><strong>48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene</strong></li>
                                While this book receives a lot of criticism for it's tutorial-like phrasing how to manipulate and gain power over others, it can be a great source for 
                                people to better recognize and handle when they are being taken advantage of. It's full of captivating history showing these laws in practice and resulting 
                                transgressions against them too. Everyone needs to feel in control of their lives, and <u>power doesn't determine someone's morals. 
                                Their morals determine how their power is used.</u>
    
                                <li><strong>Thinking in Bets by Anne Duke</strong></li>
                                Poker and chess are well known strategy games, but what makes poker a more useful skill, at least in my opinion and the author's, is that poker is based 
                                on imperfect information&mdash;players don't have all the facts. Unlike chess, poker allows for players to bluff and win despite a bad hand. In life, we rarely 
                                have all the information before making a big decision; it's important to make the best one with what you have, and that's what Anne Duke teaches in her book.
                            
                                <li><strong>Atomic Habits by James Clear:</strong></li>
                                Both my parents recently read and love this book. They recommend it to everyone they speak with. While I have not read the book, I did love the summary of it

                            <li><strong>Carmilla by J. Sheridan Le Fanu</strong></li>
                            A classic of 19th century Gothic literature, Carmilla is one of the earliest examples of vampire fiction and was written 
                            before "Dracula" by 26 years. 
                            <br> <br>
                            "Laura and her father live in Styria in the remote Austrian countryside. When a mysterious 
                            carriage crashes outside their castle, they agree to take in one of its passengers, a frail girl named Carmilla. Laura and 
                            Carmilla are immediate friends, but as the relationship grows more and more intense, Laura's health starts to decline and 
                            Carmilla's to improve&mdash;almost as if Carmilla is sucking the life out of her host."
                            
                            <li><strong>Alice Isn't Dead By Joseph Fink</strong></li>
                            "Keisha Taylor lived a quiet life with her wife, Alice, until the day that Alice disappeared. After months of searching, presuming she was 
                            dead, Keisha held a funeral, mourned, and gradually tried to get on with her life. But that was before Keisha started to see her wife, 
                            again and again, in the background of news reports from all over America. Alice isn't dead, and she is showing up at every major tragedy 
                            and accident in the country."

                            <li><strong>Gone Girl By Gillian Flynn</strong></li>
                            "The story revolves around the disappearance of Nick Dunne's wife Amy, and the sense of suspense in the novel comes from whether Nick is 
                            responsible for the disappearance. Gone Girl is a story about men and women who live double lives not because they're secret agents or 
                            jewel thieves but because as human beings they're incapable of being who they appear to be."

                            This website saved me my sophmore year of college when I was enrolled in MAT 21B - Calculus 2. This site has step-by-step 
                            solutions to the answers of all practice questions in virtually any textbook. I used these to study for my exams. Professor Leonard
                            was also an incredible source to learn the entire calculus series. He clearly explains section concepts and gives you practice questions

                                setting, you can.

                <p>Outside of the classroom, I still have a long list of things I want to learn ranging from cognitive, strategic, and kinesthetic skills. My future goals are to
                    learn the Russian language, to better communicate and connect with my friends, navigate the strategic depths of poker, one day beating my dad and winning 
                    a family game night, and add more physical exercise into my life, specifically learning a self-defense art.

                    <li><a href="https://www.russianforfree.com/" title="russianforfree.com"><strong>Russian</strong></a></li>
                    I had a friend who loved to teach me Russian words and introduced me to Russian traditions, music, and common meals. I realized that I am fond of the culture 
                    quite a bit. I want to continue to learn the language and the culture. <a href="https://youtu.be/etr3YVbET9M?feature=shared" title="Strong Women by The Hatters">Сильная женщина</a> and

                    <li><strong>Poker</strong></li>
                    My dad loves poker and he's quite good. My mom as well. Every so often my family has a poker night, and while I'm not very good at the moment, it's still a lot of fun. My goal is to one day 
                    beat my dad. But learning and getting good at poker takes more than knowing basic probability. It's a game that requires deep study. I don't have any good materials to share at the moment 
                     unfortunately, and given the long list of activities I'm involved with, it may take a while to achieve this goal.

                     <li><strong>Jujitsu</strong></li>
                    I ran cross country for seven years&mdash;three in middle school and four in high school. While I am physically healthy and fit, my sport focused more on endurance than it did strength training,  
                    but both are incredibly important. A long life won't be very enjoyable if you can't do anything with it. For a while in college I did powerlift and enjoyed bodyweight exercises such as pull ups, 
                    but I'd love to turn strength into a skill. While jujitsu is less about strength and more about technique and leverage, I think that makes it more interesting and more effective for a self-defense art.
                    <li><strong>Crochet</strong></li>
                    In 2022, I was gifted a crochet hook and several balls of yarn for Christmas. My aunt and younger cousin had fallen in love with the hobby, and it was becoming a growing interest among my peers as 
                    well. I made a third of a hat before quitting/forgetting I had a crochet project, but I still have the supplies. Maybe one day I will pick up the interest to try again.

                    I'm not into dice stacking, but I fell into a rabbit hole of dexterity tricks finding links to Knucklebones and pen spinning for this webpage. It's a pretty cool thing to watch and definitely a skill worth 
                    mentioning. Mike Boyd has an entire Youtube channel for learning useless, but awesome-looking party tricks. Apparently this trick isn't too difficult.
